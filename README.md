# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Trend Identification in Valorant Ranked Data

This is a class project that I did for BME 6780 Data Science for Bioengineers at the University of Utah. This project utilizes the SVD to evaluate trends
in structured Valorant data from Kaggle. After feature engineering, I created a classifier using a Multilayer Perceptron to predict player ranks given
input player statistics.
